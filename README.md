# Time Series Forecasting Project

This repository provides a starting point for building a time series forecasting application. It includes a basic Python package structure along with placeholders for data loading, model definition, training, and prediction utilities.

## Directory Structure

- `src/timeseries/` - Source code for the project.
  - `data.py` - Utilities for loading and preparing time series data.
  - `model.py` - Placeholder for model definitions.
  - `train.py` - Functions to train forecasting models.
  - `predict.py` - Helpers for making predictions with a trained model.
- `data/` - Folder to store raw or processed datasets.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.
- `tests/` - Place to add unit tests.

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then start implementing your data pipeline and models inside the `src/timeseries` package.
